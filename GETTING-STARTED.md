## 🎯 Your Next Steps (In Order)

### Phase 1: Local Development (Today)

#### 1. View Your Site Locally ✅

Your dev server is already running! Open your browser:
```
http://localhost:4321
```

You should see your beautiful homepage with:
- Modern gradient hero section

#### 2. Understand What You Have (15 minutes)

Browse through these pages:

<p class="lead">
  A powerful subheadline that includes secondary keywords and explains your value proposition clearly.
</p>
```

**With your actual content:**
```astro
<h1>Professional Web Design Services in [Your City]</h1>
<p class="lead">
  Fast, beautiful, and SEO-optimized websites that help your business grow online.
