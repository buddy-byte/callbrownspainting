          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How much does house painting cost in South Alabama?</h3>
            <p>Painting costs typically range from $2.50 to $4.50 per square foot for interior work and $1.80 to $3.50 per square foot for exterior painting. The final price depends on factors like the size of your home, surface preparation needed, paint quality, and project complexity. We offer free, detailed estimates for all South Alabama properties.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How long does it take to paint a house?</h3>
            <p>Most residential painting projects take 3-7 days to complete. Interior painting typically takes 2-4 days for an average-sized home, while exterior painting usually requires 3-5 days depending on weather conditions. We'll provide you with a detailed timeline during your free estimate.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Are you licensed and insured?</h3>
            <p>Yes, Browns Painting is fully licensed and insured to work throughout South Alabama including Mobile, Baldwin, and Escambia counties. We carry comprehensive liability insurance and workers' compensation coverage, protecting both our team and your property. We're happy to provide proof of insurance upon request.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do I need to be home during the painting?</h3>
            <p>Not necessarily. Many homeowners prefer to be away during painting to avoid the inconvenience. We're fully insured and trustworthy, and can work independently once access is arranged. For interior projects, some homeowners prefer to be present initially, but it's entirely your choice.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What areas do you serve?</h3>

        <h2>🎨 Paint & Materials</h2>
        <div class="faq-container">
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What brands of paint do you use?</h3>
            <p>We primarily use premium brands like Sherwin-Williams and Benjamin Moore. These professional-grade paints offer superior coverage, durability, and color retention - essential for Alabama's humid climate. We can also accommodate specific brand preferences if you have particular requirements.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do you use low-VOC or eco-friendly paints?</h3>
            <p>Yes! We offer low-VOC and zero-VOC paint options for homeowners concerned about indoor air quality. These paints are safer for families, pets, and the environment while still providing excellent coverage and durability.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What type of paint is best for Alabama's climate?</h3>
            <p>For exteriors, we recommend 100% acrylic latex paints with mildew resistance and UV protection. For interiors, we suggest moisture-resistant paints in high-humidity areas like bathrooms and kitchens. Our experience with Alabama's climate ensures we select the right products for long-lasting results.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do you provide the paint or do I need to purchase it?</h3>
            <p>We provide all materials including paint, primer, and supplies as part of our service. This ensures we use professional-grade products and the correct quantities. However, if you've already purchased paint or have specific preferences, we're happy to work with your materials.</p>

        <div class="faq-container">
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I prepare my home for painting?</h3>
            <p>For interior projects, we recommend removing small valuables, wall decorations, and delicate items. We'll move and cover furniture. For exterior painting, please ensure access to all sides of your home and remove items from porches and decks. We handle all other preparation including cleaning, repairs, and surface prep.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do you move furniture?</h3>
            <p>Yes, we can help move furniture to the center of rooms and cover it properly. However, we recommend you move or store small valuables, electronics, and delicate items beforehand for their safety.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is pressure washing included with exterior painting?</h3>
            <p>Yes! Pressure washing is included with all exterior painting projects. Proper surface cleaning is essential for paint adhesion and longevity. We thoroughly clean all surfaces before any painting begins.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do you repair drywall and wood damage?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely. We provide complete drywall repair, patching, texture matching, and wood rot repair as part of our surface preparation. Proper repairs are crucial for a quality paint job that lasts.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What happens if it rains during exterior painting?</h3>
            <p>We monitor weather forecasts closely and only paint when we have adequate dry time. If unexpected rain occurs, we take immediate steps to protect your property. Modern paints typically need 2-4 hours to cure enough to withstand light rain, but we prefer 24-48 hours of clear weather for optimal results.</p>

            <h3>What affects the cost of a painting project?</h3>

          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do you offer payment plans?</h3>
            <p>We work with each client individually to establish a payment schedule that works for their budget. Typically, we request a deposit to schedule your project, progress payments for larger jobs, and final payment upon completion and your satisfaction.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">

        <div class="faq-container">
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How far in advance should I schedule?</h3>
            <p>We recommend scheduling 2-4 weeks in advance for most projects, especially during our busy season (spring and fall). However, we can often accommodate rush projects and always make room for emergency painting needs.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What's the best time of year for exterior painting in Alabama?</h3>
            <p>Spring and fall are ideal for exterior painting in Alabama, with mild temperatures and lower humidity. However, we can paint year-round by monitoring weather conditions and choosing appropriate days for optimal paint curing.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can you paint in winter?</h3>
            <p>Yes, we can paint interiors year-round. For exteriors, we can paint during winter months when temperatures are above 50°F and conditions are dry. Modern paints have improved cold-weather performance, making winter painting more feasible than ever.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
