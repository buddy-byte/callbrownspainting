## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES / QUIRKS

### **Character Encoding**
- ✅ FIXED: Emojis now render correctly (previously showed `ðŸ`)
- All pages use UTF-8 encoding

### **CSS Specificity**
- Some pages needed `!important` for spacing overrides
- Blog CTA section required explicit `display: block !important`

### **Vercel Build**
- ⚠️ **NEVER re-add `@astrojs/vercel` package** - causes Node.js runtime issues
- Keep build as pure static (current setup works perfectly)

### **Git Line Endings**
- Windows dev environment causes CRLF warnings (harmless)
- Git auto-converts to LF on commit

---
